# Specification Quality Checklist: Wallet Mnemonic Management (BIP39/BIP44)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-15

**Summary**: All quality criteria met. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Details**:
- Content Quality: 4/4 items passed
- Requirement Completeness: 8/8 items passed
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 items passed

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear user-focused scenarios with independent testability
- Comprehensive security requirements aligned with ArcSign Constitution
- Measurable success criteria without implementation details
- Well-documented assumptions and edge cases

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` without requiring `/speckit.clarify`
- All functional requirements map to user stories
- Security requirements fully align with Security-First Development principle
